# XBeeUartMQTTProxy
A TCP/IP Proxy to tunnel MQTT Messages over UART using a XBee Device
a Java implementation

==Libraries needed==

xbee-java-library-1.3.0.jar
slf4j-api-1.7.12.jar
rxtx-2.2.jar (remember you also need the JNI native library for your operating system)

Optional (if you want to see logging output from the XBee Device)

slf4j-simple-1.7.12.jar

There is no strict need on the version numbers, this are the versions which I used - which were available of the time of this writing -
